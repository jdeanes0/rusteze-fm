Welcome to the Rusteze File Manager!


# PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE CONTRIBUTING
When you want to add to the repository, create a feature branch with:
```
git checkout -b <feature_branch> master
```
Then, push that branch to the repository and create a pull request through GitHub to merge into master.

Finally, on branches that are not master after the PR completes:
```
git rebase -i master
```

Use `npx tailwindcss -i ./style.css -o ./twstyle.css` to build the tailwind file whenever you want to see new changes.
