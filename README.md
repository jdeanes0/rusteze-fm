# PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE CONTRIBUTING
When you want to add to the repository, create a feature branch with:
```
git checkout -b <feature_branch> master
```
Then, push that branch to the repository and create a pull request through GitHub to merge into master.

Finally, on branches that are not master after the PR completes:
```
git rebase -i master
```
Just trust in vscode and it will work. Inshallah.
